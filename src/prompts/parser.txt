You are a fact extraction assistant. 

Given the CLAIM: "{claim}" and the underlying TRUTH: "{truth}", extract key facts that can be compared to assess whether the claim faithfully represents the truth.

For each fact, do the following:
1. Assign a category
2. Record what the claim states (claim_says)
3. Record what the truth states (truth_says)
4. Add a brief note if necessary (e.g. "mismatch", "omitted in claim", "added in claim", "not supported by truth")
