You are judging a fact-checking jury debate. Read the transcript and decide:

1. CONCEDED: Has either side explicitly conceded, changed their vote, or agreed with the opposing side? (e.g., "You're right", "I was wrong", "I now agree")

2. NO_NEW_ARGUMENTS: Did the last exchange (the two most recent speeches) add anything substantively new?
   - Answer YES (stop) only if: The second speaker simply restated their original position WITHOUT engaging with, rebutting, or addressing the first speaker's specific claims. True stalemate: both sides have said their piece and are just repeating.
   - Answer NO (continue) if: The second speaker rebutted, countered, or directly responded to the first speaker's points—even when discussing the same topic. Engagement and counter-argument count as new substance.
   - When in doubt, prefer NO (let the debate continue).

Be conservative: only mark conceded if there is a clear concession; only mark no_new_arguments if the last exchange clearly adds nothing—i.e., the second speaker did not engage with what was just said.
